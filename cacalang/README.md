# cacalang

A small, C-like language with a compiler that both interprets programs and
compiles them to real .NET assemblies. Programs can call into .NET — the
standard library, or your own C# assemblies — through `extern` functions.
Builds and runs on Windows, macOS and Linux.

```
func isPrime(n: int): bool do
    if n < 2 then return false; end;

    var factor = 2;
    while factor * factor <= n do
        if n % factor == 0 then return false; end;
        factor = factor + 1;
    end;

    return true;
end

for n = 2 to 30 do
    if isPrime(n) then print n + " is prime"; end;
end;
```

## Getting started

Requires the [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

```sh
dotnet build
dotnet test
```

Run a program, or compile it to an executable and run that:

```sh
dotnet run --project src/Caca.Cli -- run samples/helloworld.caca

dotnet run --project src/Caca.Cli -- build samples/helloworld.caca
./helloworld.exe
```
